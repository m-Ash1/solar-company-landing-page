          <p>
            We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in
            mind. That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system
            before outright replacing it, wherever possible â€“ it requires fewer
            materials and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If
            another company tells you that your system needs to be replaced,
            just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

            <p>
              As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come
              cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so
              we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more
              affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the
              environment, rather than on turning a profit.

            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
              As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet
              and about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly
              approach to power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled
              and opaque, so we want to help educate people on the big and
              little things they can do to protect our planet!
